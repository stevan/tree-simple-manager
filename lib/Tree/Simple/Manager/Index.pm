=head1 NAME

Tree::Simple::Manager::Index - A class for quick-access indexing for Tree::Simple hierarchies

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tree::Simple::Manager::Index;
  
  my $index = Tree::Simple::Manager::Index->new($tree_hierarchy);  
  my $node_deep_in_the_tree = $index->getTreeByID(100134);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will index a Tree::Simple hierarchy so that node's can be quickly accessed without needing to search the entire heirarchy. It currently will index the Tree::Simple nodes by their UID property. Plans for allowing other means of indexing are in the future.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new ($tree)>

Given a C<$tree> it will index all it's nodes by their UID values.

=item B<indexTree>

This will take the root tree (the C<$tree> arguments in C<new>) and index it. This method can be overridden by a subclass to provide custom indexing functionality. See the L<SUBCLASSING> section below.

=item B<getIndexKeys>

This will return a list of all the index keys. 

=item B<getRootTree>

This will return the root of the indexed tree.

=item B<getTreeByID ($id)>

Given an C<$id> this will return the tree associated with it. If no tree is associated with it, an exeception will be thrown.

=item B<hasTreeAtID ($id)>

Returns a boolean if there is a tree associated with that C<$id>.

=head1 SUBCLASSING

This module will index a Tree::Simple hierarchy using the UID property of each tree node (fetched with the C<getUID> method of Tree::Simple). This works well with the Tree::Simple::Manager's default tree file parser filter, which expects a tree file format which supplies an id field. It is obvious that this approach may not be useful in all cases, so I have built this module too easily allow for subclassing and customization of the indexing process. 

You will need to override the C<indexTree> method. The root tree is accessible by the C<getRootTree> method, and the index is a hash reference available as a public field C<$self-E<gt>{index}>. How you choose to construct the index from here is up to you. Here are a couple of things to keep in mind though.

=over

=item Duplicate index keys

We throw an exception in the default indexer if we notice a duplicate key being created. It is the responsibility of the subclass author to check.

=back

=head1 BUGS

None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it. 

=head1 CODE COVERAGE

I use B<Devel::Cover> to test the code coverage of my tests, see the L<Tree::Simple::Manager> documentation for more details.
